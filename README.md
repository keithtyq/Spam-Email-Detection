# Spam-Email-Detection
This project uses the SpamAssassin dataset to build and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and multiple classification algorithms to accurately detect spam emails.

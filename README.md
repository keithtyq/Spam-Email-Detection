# Spam-Email-Detection
This project uses the SpamAssassin dataset to build and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and multiple classification algorithms to accurately detect spam emails.

# Aim 
This project seeks to tackle these challenges by examining spammer strategies, investigating the dataset shift problem, and assessing the effectiveness of spam filters in a dynamic, non-stationary environment.

# Models used 
1. Random forest
2. K-nearest neighbors
3. Deep Learning
4. Logistic Regression
5. Naive Bayes
